Between September and December 2018, we noticed that the market slowed down and shifted from a seller’s market to more of a balanced market. The average home was taking two to four weeks to sell, rather than the one to two weeks it took prior to the shift. There was also a lot more inventory; a number of homes were sitting on the market for more than 30 days. In turn, that **caused more sellers to reduce their prices than we’d seen in a long time.** Additionally, multiple-offer situations seemed to fade away.

**But the market did become more balanced.** We noticed that buyers had many more options to choose from, allowing them a bit more agency—they didn’t have to scramble to make an offer immediately after finding a home they liked, but could instead take their time and look around at other homes, too.

**One of the main factors that caused this shift was the increase in mortgage rates.** At the beginning of 2018, the average mortgage rate for a 30-year fixed conventional loan was somewhere in the low- to mid-fours. As you know by now, the Fed raised rates several times throughout the year, and we saw it go as high as 5.2% around October and November. The last time we saw mortgage rates increase to the fives was around 2008.

Whenever rates increase by that much, **it has an effect on home affordability,** which then affects demand. Now that we’re at the beginning of January, we’ve seen that rates have dipped back down a little bit; the average mortgage rate for a 30-year fixed conventional loan is around 4.7%.

In 2019, mortgage rates will be the thing to keep an eye on. We’re expecting that the Fed will raise rates again, but we can’t be sure by how much. If that does happen again, it will obviously have an impact on affordability and demand. In the meantime, **don’t worry—the market may have slowed down, but it’s still very healthy and strong.** Sellers are still getting good offers, even without the crazy bidding wars. Buyers have an opportunity to shop around and get a fair take on properties before making an offer. Overall, it’s a great time to both buy and sell houses.

If you have any questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to me. I’d be happy to have a discussion with you.<br>&nbsp;
