What is “days on market”? When a seller lists their home for sale, days on market is the number of days the house sits before it sells. What is the average number of days on market in San Jose? If the property is priced, prepared, and marketed properly, it typically takes an average home 14 to 21 days to sell. If a home has not sold in at least 30 days, it is likely priced too high.&nbsp;

**If your house is priced too high you have two options:**

1. Lower the price
2. Wait it out and hope to get your price
