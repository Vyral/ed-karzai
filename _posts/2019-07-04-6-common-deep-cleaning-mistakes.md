As homeowners, we see spring and summer as prime opportunities to get some of our deep cleaning taken care of. Before you roll up your sleeves and get to work, though, be mindful of these common cleaning mistakes.&nbsp;

**1\. Not having a plan.** Anything worth doing starts with a plan. Without one, you’ll be pretty aimless in your cleaning efforts.&nbsp;

**2\. Using dirty tools.** Most of us have been guilty of this at some point—using a dirty towel, mop, sponges, or gloves. Not only does it defeat the purpose, but it’ll just make the area you mean to clean that much dirtier.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>**3\. Trying to do it all on your own.** Deep cleaning your home can be a substantial undertaking, and going it alone is likely to be an overwhelming experience. Try delegating some of the work to other members of your household. If you have kids, one way of doing that is to make them responsible for cleaning their own room.

**4\. Trying to do it all in one day.** Much like No. 3, cleaning your home from top to bottom in one day is ambitious, but not realistic. For most of us, our best opportunity is on weekends, so this is where your plan comes into play. Map out your cleaning activities over a few weekends, and don’t be surprised if it takes a month or two.

**5\. Holding on to too much stuff.** Most of us have been collecting excessive amounts of clutter in our closets, garage, and other storage areas for years. Now’s the time to toss it, give some of it away, or donate it. You’ll be glad you did.&nbsp;

**6\. Keeping your windows closed.** Though it seems like common sense, this cleaning misstep goes unconsidered by a lot of homeowners. Open windows will help filter some of the debris and dust particles out of the air and will allow fresh air to circulate. &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;

Bonus tip: Wear latex gloves and a mask that covers both your mouth and nose to ensure that you’re not breathing in cleaning agents and that your contact with them is minimal.
