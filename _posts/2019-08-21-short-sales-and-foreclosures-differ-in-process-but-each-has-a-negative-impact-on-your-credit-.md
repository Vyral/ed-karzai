What is a foreclosure? What is a short sale? What’s the difference between these two real estate transactions?

Let’s start with a foreclosure. **This happens when a homeowner stops making their mortgage payments.** In general, if you miss three or more consecutive months of payments, the bank will file a notice of default, which then goes on your title report. After the notice is filed, they’ll allow you another month or so to pay off the overdue balance. If you do, the foreclosure stops. If you don’t and continue to fall behind on your payments, the bank proceeds with the foreclosure.

The first step of the foreclosure is vacating the home in question. If you refuse to leave, you can be evicted. After that, they’ll sell the home at an auction or through the open market.&nbsp;

At an auction, they’ll sell the home to the highest bidder, usually for cash and in as-is condition. Oftentimes, the buyer makes the purchase sight unseen. If they put it on the open market, they’ll hire a Realtor and do a conventional sale just like any regular home seller. They’ll disclose the fact that the home is a foreclosure, but they’ll still try to get the highest price possible. If you buy a foreclosure property, the only difference is you deal with a bank the whole time.

**A short sale occurs when the homeowner owes more than what the home is worth.** For example, if you owe $600,000 on the home and sell it for $500,000, you’d still be short $100,000 from paying their loan in full. That’s why it’s called a “short” sale.&nbsp;

If you want to sell your home as a short sale, you need to get approved by your bank first. To approve your sale, they’ll usually check if you’ve had some sort of hardship. By the bank’s standards, hardships include a job loss, health issues, divorce, the loss of a loved one, or other life-changing events. &nbsp;

Once you’re approved to do a short sale, it’s up to you to hire a real estate agent, list the home on the open market (and market it as a short sale), and sell it for as much money possible. The bank will then pay your closing costs and forgive the difference that you’re short.&nbsp;

**Both of these transactions will have a negative impact on your credit.** Short sales typically stay on a credit report for three years, while foreclosures stay on for five to seven years. During that time, it’s pretty much impossible for you to qualify for another loan to buy a home, so you’ll have to wait until either of these sales are removed from your credit report.&nbsp;
