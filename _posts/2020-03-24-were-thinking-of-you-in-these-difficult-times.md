No matter who we are, or where we live, or what we do, the coronavirus has affected us all in one way or another. I want to let you know that, in this very peculiar time, I’m thinking of you and your family; you’re in my thoughts and prayers.&nbsp;

I’m incredibly confident that we’ll get through this, but we have to stick together and be safe—and smart. More than anything, we have to rely on our common sense.&nbsp;

Since this isn’t my typical educational post, I won’t be addressing real estate. That being said, if you have questions about real estate or want to chat about the market in general, please reach out to me. I’m always happy to have a conversation with you. Until then, please take care of yourselves.
