Today I’m sharing a real estate market snapshot for Santa Clara County so you have all the most recent data.&nbsp;

In December 2020, the median sale price for single-family homes was $1,355,000. In January 2021 it was $1,370,000, and in February it was $1,462,000.&nbsp;

In December, the average sale-to-list ratio was 102.5%, in January it was 103.3%, and in February it was 105.4%. If a house was listed in February for $1 million, that means, on average, that property sold for $54,000 over its list price. **This is a very hot seller’s market**; inventory is low, demand is high, rates are low, homes are selling quickly, and they’re selling way over asking price.&nbsp;

The median days on market refers to how long it takes houses to sell. In both December and January, the average days on market was nine days, and it was eight days in February.&nbsp;

Remember that all this data is based on averages. Many properties are selling for more money and in less time. **Each home is different, so the numbers depend on the house’s location, floor plan, condition, and more.&nbsp;**

The average single-family home has increased in price by 10% to 15% in just one year, which is a large gain. Where this market goes from here remains to be seen, but interest rates will have a huge impact. If rates rise, the market may slow down some.
