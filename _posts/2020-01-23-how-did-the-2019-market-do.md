Today, let’s take a look back on the 2019 real estate market as a whole to understand how the observed market trends impacted where we are in our current market.

The numbers we pulled showed us that between 2018 and 2019, the average median sales price dropped by about 10%. However, the net decrease was actually about 5%, since prices dropped down and then climbed back up some.

So why did prices go down?

{% include pullquote.html %}&nbsp;

One of the main reasons was that right around the fall of 2018, mortgage rates started to increase, rising up as high as the low fives. For a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage, that’s the highest rate since the Great Recession of 2008, which had a huge impact on buyers. A sizable segment of buyers at the time could no longer afford to buy homes because of the rate spike, and another portion of consumers lost confidence in the market, causing them to wait on the sidelines.

In the spring of 2019, rates dropped considerably, falling as far as the middle threes; they hadn’t been that low for two years. That sparked the market back up again, and even today, rates on a 30-year fixed-rate mortgage average in the high threes, which is still very low.

So where does that leave us today? Well, today’s market is very healthy. There are still a lot of buyers in the market, rates are low, sellers are still getting good prices.

As always, if you have any further questions about the market or real estate in general, don’t hesitate to reach out. I would love to hear from you.
