If you’re a seller, how can you back out of a sale? You have options, and I want to discuss them with you today.&nbsp;

One way you can back out of a contract is **if you can prove your buyer isn’t performing.** Let’s say the buyer had three days to put their deposit in escrow. If they fail to put in the deposit, the seller has the right to send a notice to perform. When the buyer receives this notice, they have two days to do what they need to do. If they still haven’t put the money in escrow, then the seller can legally walk away.&nbsp;

A similar example is when **a buyer takes too long to do their inspection.** If a buyer has 10 days to do an inspection, but they miss their deadline, the buyer has to remove their inspection contingency if they want to move forward. From here, it’s the same process. You send them a notice to perform, and if they haven’t completed the inspection in two days, you can walk away.&nbsp;

Buyers not performing is the most common way sellers can get out of a contract. A less common scenario is **if the seller has a contingency to find a replacement property.** In this case, the sale of the home is contingent on the seller finding a new home. If they don’t find one, the seller reserves the right to cancel the home sale. Most sellers don’t do this because it turns off buyers, but it is an option.&nbsp;

Typically, when a seller refuses to go through with a contract and nothing unusual happened, the buyer can sue to force the sale of the home. If you’re looking to sell, make sure you work with a professional so that you don’t end up in a scenario where you regret signing the contract. If you have any questions, please call or email me. I am always willing to help.
