You’ve probably heard tons of people speculating about our real estate market. For every person, there’s a different opinion. That’s why today I want to give you a data-driven market update focused on the last three months. **All the data I’ll be talking about today applies to single-family homes in Santa Clara County.**&nbsp;

Our median sales prices for August, September, and October were $1,630,000, $1,610,000, and $1,635,000 respectively. Meanwhile, our list-to-sales price ratios were 108.1% for August, 107.0% for September, and 110.4% for October. This means that so far this month, people are receiving on average 10.4% more than their asking price at closing.&nbsp;

The average single-family home took eight days to sell in August, nine days in September, and eight days in October. Things are moving so fast, **it’s barely taking over a week to sell a home.**&nbsp;

Finally, let’s take a look at how much the average single-family Santa Clara County home has gone up in value since this time last year. Since October 2020, the average home has increased in value by 17%.&nbsp;

Hopefully, this gave you a good idea of how our market is looking. As you can see, things are still strong, so if you’re looking to buy or sell a home, please reach out to me. I am always willing to help.
