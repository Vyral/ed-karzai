If buyers aren’t enticed by your home the moment they lay their eyes on it, then the selling process will be a long and stressful one for you. So, what are some practical things you can do to boost your home’s curb appeal? For the best results, start with these four areas:&nbsp;

**1\. Apply a fresh coat of paint.** This is the quickest way to revitalize the appearance of your home, and it’s relatively inexpensive. When choosing colors, stick with beiges and grays; those two colors (and their derivatives) are very popular right now, and neutral colors will always be the safest option. For the moldings and trim, most people use white paint. If you don't want a white front door to match the trim, other popular door colors include blues, reds, and black.&nbsp;

Window shutters are usually a different color than the house itself, so if you have these, consider matching them with the front door or choosing some other color that’s not so loud. If your home’s paint job isn’t old, perhaps you just need to power wash the exterior. You’d be surprised by all the grime and gunk that can accumulate from exposure to the elements.&nbsp;

**2\. Improve your landscaping.** Is your lawn green and vibrant, or has it seen better days? Yellow and brown lawns just won’t do. You could have the best house in the neighborhood, but if your lawn is lackluster, buyers won’t even bother. Make sure it’s mowed well, and trim all your bushes.&nbsp;

Once those basics are taken care of, consider adding some varied flowers for extra color. You don’t have to go overboard with your garden, but a freshly mulched, flowering garden that’s free of weeds is sure to impress buyers.&nbsp;

**3\. Redo the driveway and/or walkway with pavers**. Bricks work just as well as pavers, but modernizing all paths to the home is huge. A revamped driveway will increase the value of your home and serve as a strong piece in your total curb appeal package.&nbsp;

**4\. Update the garage door**. Believe it or not, an updated garage door does wonders for the appearance of a home. You can get one that has windows, a sleek, modern design, or even one with fancy handles. Whatever you choose, it’ll almost certainly be better than leaving an old, dilapidated, or dented door on your garage.&nbsp;

These are just a few areas of impact that I’ve noted in my time as a Realtor. I hope you found this list useful\! As always, don’t hesitate to reach out to me with more questions on curb appeal or real estate in general. I’m glad to be of assistance anytime.
