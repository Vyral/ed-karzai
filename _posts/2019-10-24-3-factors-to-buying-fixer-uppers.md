I receive many questions about buying fixer-uppers. If you’re thinking about buying a fixer-upper, there are three main questions to ask yourself about undertaking this task:

**1\. What is your motivation?** There are commonly three reasons people have for buying a fixer-upper. You may think you’ll be able to get a deal below market price, you want to get a house that you can remodel to your taste, or you want to do a flip: Flipping a home means fixing up the property to sell later for a profit. The turnaround for this is generally around six months.&nbsp;

**2\. How are you going to pay for it?** Buying the home is one thing, but most of the time you’re going need some cash in hand after the purchase. This is for remodeling. True, there is a type of loan where the mortgage lender will allow you to use a portion of the loan for remodeling. However, these loans are uncommon. The requirements and criteria are strict. Don’t bet on receiving this type of loan.

However, if you’re a homeowner that’s fine with buying a fixer-upper you can live in for a while as you gradually remodel, you may not need the cash on hand.&nbsp;

**3\. Do you want to deal with it?** Can you manage the project? Buying a fixer-upper is stressful—it involves a lot of work, many costs are involved, and there are many factors to consider. You’ll need to hire many people to do the work involved: contractors, painters, a handyman, a landscaper, and so on. You’ll be handling permits. Are you willing to deal with the stress and time it takes? You’ll need to be patient. If you’re living in the house during the remodel, that’s one of the most stressful elements you’ll have to deal with.&nbsp;

Frequently, remodeling projects cost more than the average budget set. People commonly go over budget, it’s just the nature of the beast. If you can handle all this, maybe buying a fixer-upper is a good idea for you.&nbsp;
