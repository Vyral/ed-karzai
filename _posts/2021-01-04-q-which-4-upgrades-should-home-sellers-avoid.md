If you’re ready to prepare your home for the market, there are certain upgrades you should avoid that may look aesthetically pleasing but won’t give you a good return on your investment. Here are four such upgrades:

**1\. Remodeling second or third stories.** If you live in a multi-level home, focus your remodeling efforts on the main level (i.e., where the kitchen is). This is the floor that buyers will focus on, so if you upgrade any upstairs bedrooms, for example, you won’t get the same return on investment.&nbsp;

**2\. Adding crown molding or wainscoting.** This is especially true if you add crown molding to any bedrooms or hallways.&nbsp;

**3\. Building an accent wall.** Again, this upgrade may look nice, but it doesn’t increase the value of your home.&nbsp;

**4\. Making any costly upgrades.** This means replacing the furnace, water heater, or air conditioner. If these items are functioning properly, there’s no need to replace them if you’re looking to maximize your home’s value. If they’re not working, obviously it’s a no-brainer to replace them.&nbsp;

Instead of trying these upgrades, spend your money on high-value areas like the kitchen (as mentioned above), main-level bathrooms, flooring, and outdoor landscape. Another high-value upgrade to consider is repainting—both the exterior and interior.&nbsp;

That being said, if you’re not concerned about getting the biggest bang for your buck when selling, you have the time and money to make these upgrades, and you still want to make them, by all means, go for it\!
