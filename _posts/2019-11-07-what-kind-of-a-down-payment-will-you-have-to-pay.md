As a buyer, what kind of a down payment should you expect to make when applying for financing?

First, don’t believe the common misconception that you must put down 20% to buy a home. That’s absolutely not true; lenders are more flexible than that. However, you still need to qualify for financing. If you do qualify, you can put as little as 3.5% down (if you use an FHA loan). After you qualify, the less you put down, the more your monthly payment will be.&nbsp;

When you meet with a lender to qualify for financing, they’ll look at three main criteria: **income, debt, and credit score.** For your income, they’ll take into account your gross income. If you’re a W-2 employee, they’ll use your monthly gross income. If you’re self-employed, they’ll use your adjusted net income.

For example, let’s say you’re a W-2 employee and you make $120,000 per year. That would make your monthly gross income $10,000. For your debt, they’ll calculate your debt-to-income ratio (DTI) by taking into account your monthly credit card payments, car loan payments, and any other revolving monthly payments. Most lenders won’t allow your debt to exceed 45% to 50% of your gross monthly income. In this case, that would be $4,500 to $5,000—that sum has to include all of your revolving debt.

Essentially, **the higher your income, the more qualified you’ll be to put less money down.&nbsp;**
