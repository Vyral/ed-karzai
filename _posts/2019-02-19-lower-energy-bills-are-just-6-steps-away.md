If costly heating bills have been weighing on your mind (and wallet) lately, these six tips will help lighten the load and reduce your monthly energy expenses.

**1. Regularly replace your furnace filter.** Not only will this improve your heater’s function and reduce your monthly bills, but it will also keep your system in good shape and, therefore, lengthen its lifespan.&nbsp;<br><br>**2. Clean your air ducts.** Doing this every other year or at least once every three years will keep your heater running smoothly.

**3. Keep your return vents clear.** These larger vents, which take air in and return it to the furnace, must remain clear. If they are blocked, this could damage your system.&nbsp;<br><br>**4. Have a licensed professional inspect your heater or HVAC.** Even if you’re taking care of the maintenance items we’ve already touched on, this doesn’t mean there isn’t a chance something else might be wrong with the system. Having someone come out to perform a checkup every couple of years will be key to lowering your bills and avoiding costly repairs.&nbsp;<br><br>**5. Turn exhaust fans off.** If left on, these fans will suck the heat right out of your home.&nbsp;<br><br>**6. Make sure your attic is insulated.** Heat rises, and it will rise all the way out of your property if your attic isn’t insulated.&nbsp;
