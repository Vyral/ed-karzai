Everyone knows that our market dipped toward the end of 2018, but things have definitely stabilized since then. With the first quarter of 2019 now behind us, it’s time to review how real estate conditions evolved at the beginning of this year.&nbsp;

There are several developments that buyers, sellers, and homeowners alike should take note of. For one thing, cash offers and multiple-offer situations have become rarer. **Homes are still selling—it’s just taking a little longer for them to do so.&nbsp;**

Nowadays, most listings sell in about three to four weeks of being on the market and are earning approximately 97% of their asking price. With that said, it’s clear to see that although the market has slowed down, it’s still a great time to make a move.

And **with rates still in the low-4% range, it’s still a good market to buy in, as well.**&nbsp;

This is especially true for “entry-level” price points, where activity is still high. The luxury market, meanwhile, has somewhat slowed. It just goes to show that conditions vary vastly depending on your location and price point, among other things.

**So what does this all mean for you?**

In short, it’s time to act. Our market is very strong and balanced right now. Buyers and sellers alike have a lot of opportunity before them, so if you’ve been thinking of pursuing your real estate goals, please reach out.

As always, we’d be happy to talk or answer any questions you may have. If you’d like more information or want to talk about your plans to buy or sell, feel free to give us a call or send us an email. We look forward to hearing from you soon.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
