A lot goes into a real estate transaction, but there are some things that home sellers may not quite understand. Here are the top six misconceptions sellers often have:

**1. They think can sell on their own.** Technically, you can put up a for-sale sign and see what happens, but there’s a lot more involved in selling a home. You want the knowledge and expertise of a real estate professional. They’ll help you prepare, negotiate, and market your listing—not to mention all the paperwork they’ll take off your hands!

**2. They think their home is worth more.** A home is very personal, so of course sellers think their own is worth more than what it really is. You have to be logical and look at market data in order to give your home an accurate value.

**3. They think they can sell their home as is.** If you’re in a highly competitive market, you may be able to sell a home as is. It’s more likely though that you’ll need to declutter, clean, and make repairs in order to attract serious buyers.

**4. They think remodeling is necessary.** Remodeling a home can be overkill—you can end up spending more than what your renovations will net you in the sale. Instead, keep it simple and only make changes that will give the biggest bang for your buck.

**5. They think they need to sell in a specific time of year.** Many believe that spring is the only good time to sell, but if your home is priced right, marketed correctly, and prepared sufficiently, you’ll be able to sell for a great price anytime.

**6. They think they can rely on online evaluation tools.** These websites can help you get an idea of your home’s worth, but if you’re actually going to sell your home, you need a professional’s help. They’ll do a market analysis, check comparable homes, and much more. There are many factors that go into home pricing, and each one is important to look at.
