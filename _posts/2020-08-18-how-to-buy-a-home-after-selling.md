If you’re selling your home and get a great offer but you haven’t found your new home yet, what should you do? That’s a question I hear all the time, so I’ll show you what your options are today.

**First, you can put an addendum in the contract that protects you.** The “Seller’s Purchase of Replacement Property” addendum allows you to cancel a contract with a buyer if you can’t find a replacement property within a certain time frame. If you don’t have that and you’ve sold your home, you can not cancel the agreement without this addendum.&nbsp;

**Another option is what’s called a rent-back.** This happens after the close of escrow and allows you to stay in your home for a period of time (usually a few weeks to a few months) where you have time to find your new home and get moved out without being too rushed. The rent-back amount is typically whatever the homeowner would be paying for their mortgage, utilities, etc. They don’t want to take a loss on the investment.

From the day that you accept an offer as a seller, it takes 30 days to close escrow. Another two months after that gives you about 90 days to find a replacement property after you’ve gotten an offer accepted on your home.

**Your final option is also the least desirable.** If all other options fail, you'll have to move out of your property and into a rental while you find your new home. You’ll have to move twice, but sometimes it’s an inevitability.

If you have any questions about buying a home, selling a home, or real estate in general, don't hesitate to call or email today. I look forward to hearing from you.
