What are the rooms inside your home that, if remodeled, would bring you the best return on your investment (ROI)?&nbsp;

The simple answer is **kitchens and bathrooms, by far.** I would start with the kitchen first—it’s the heart of the home where people spend most of their time.&nbsp;

You can do the kitchen two different ways. The first is a structural remodel, meaning that you could knock down a wall to open it up. Ideally, if you do choose to open up your kitchen, you’ll &nbsp;want it to open up to another living space, like a family room. This creates the best atmosphere. Another structural change that will give you great ROI is adding an island. Homebuyers love these, and yours doesn’t have to be too fancy or complex.&nbsp;

Next, focus on the cosmetic changes. Add **new counters, cabinets, appliances, lighting, backsplash, and flooring.** These are a surefire way to create a more attractive space.&nbsp;

As far as bathrooms go, attack the master first, then worry about the additional ones. Keep them clean, simple, and use light colors. If necessary, get new vanities, flooring, bathtubs/showers, lighting and fixtures. **Make sure that you have at least one bathtub in one of your bathrooms.** Many homebuyers do expect their future home to have a tub.
