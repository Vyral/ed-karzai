What is a comparative market analysis (CMA) and how does it calculate the value of your home?&nbsp;

Basically, **it’s a report we real estate agents use to figure out the market value of a property.** This report is sectioned into two parts—the first involves “comps” (i.e., comparable sales), while the second involves adjustments made to the comps.&nbsp;

To figure out the comparable sales within your neighborhood, there are certain guidelines we follow. Ideally, we look at homes within a half-mile radius of yours. If you go any further than that, the properties don’t qualify as “comparable” anymore. Also, we look at homes that have the same number of bedrooms and bathrooms.&nbsp;

In terms of size, we only look at homes that are within 200 square feet of your home’s overall square footage. If they’re not within that range, they’re either too big or too small. When it comes to lot size, the comparable range is 1,000 square feet.

We also prefer not to look at data that’s older than three months. Sometimes, though, this is unavoidable—in some neighborhoods, homes don’t sell very often. If this is the case, we’ll go back six months, but any data past that time period is considered pretty old.&nbsp;

Once we have all our data gathered, we really only need three comparable sales to figure out the market value of your home. Pending sales are also useful because they’re even newer.&nbsp;

**After you have all your comps, it’s time to make adjustments to them, of which there are three:&nbsp;**

**1\. Condition.** If you find a comp that sold for $700,000 but that home is a fixer-upper while yours is remodeled, your home will be valued higher.&nbsp;

**2\. Location.** You can have two homes on the same street, but if one of those homes sits on the corner and is around a lot of noise, that makes a big difference.&nbsp;

**3\. Schools.** You can have multiple school districts in the same neighborhood, but those school districts might be rated differently, which can have a big impact on home values.&nbsp;
