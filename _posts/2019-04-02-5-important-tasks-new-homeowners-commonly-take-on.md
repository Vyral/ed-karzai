Here are five things buyers typically do after moving into a new house:

**1. Change the locks.** You don’t know who else has access to your new home, so re-keying the locks is an obvious security measure. 

**2. Clean the whole house.** A lot of buyers hire a professional to give their house a good, deep clean after they buy it. Certain areas are particularly common to focus on:

* The carpet—If your house is carpeted, it’s a good idea to get it professionally steam-cleaned. If the carpet has a lot of wear and tear, you might be better off just replacing it. 
* Air ducts—These ducts can get pretty dirty over time, so cleaning them and replacing the filter in your furnace is a no-brainer.  
* Chimney—If your house has a chimney and a fireplace and you plan on using that fireplace, it’s a good idea to get the chimney cleaned. 
* Window fixtures.

**3. Paint the interior.** If the inside of your new home hasn’t been painted in a while, painting it is the best way to give it a clean, fresh, new look. This will also give you a good bang for your buck when the time comes to sell it.

**4. Purchase new appliances.** Refrigerators, washers, and dryers are the most commonly bought appliances in this case because they’re negotiable in the transaction, and sellers don’t always include them as part of the overall sale. 

**5. Install new window treatments.** Oftentimes, the window treatments sellers leave behind are dirty or used up, or they just remove the window treatments so they can paint the house and never bother putting them back on. If buyers don’t feel like cleaning them, they end up getting new curtains or blinds when they move in. Some buyers get really fancy and add new plantation shutters.
