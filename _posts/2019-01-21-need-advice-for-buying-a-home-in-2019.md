Today I’ve got some general information for you if you’re looking to buy a home in 2019. Let’s start at the beginning:&nbsp;**The first step for you should always be to get with a good lender and get approved for a home loan.** This is not only going to tell you what kind of home you qualify for, but it will also help you with your search and let you know exactly what your interest rate will be for the life of the loan. This is all vital information for homeowners.&nbsp;

In addition, a pre-approval will allow you to include a pre-approval letter with your offer. These days, sellers won’t take you seriously without a pre-approval letter.

**Now let’s look at where interest rates are.** They went up in 2018 and maxed out at about 5.1% in November, but they have since dropped to a 4.7% average. We are hearing that rates will go up in 2019, but how much or when remains to be seen.

As far as your credit score is concerned, most lenders will look at scores as low as 620 to qualify you. Some will even go to 580 or under, but remember that the lower your credit score, the higher your interest rate will be.&nbsp;

**Traditionally, down payments were always 20% of the purchase price, but lenders are much more flexible these days.** You can put 15%, 10%, or even 5% down with the right loan. However, the less you put down, the higher your monthly mortgage payment will be. To get the right monthly payment, you need to put down the right amount.

I hope you found this information useful. If you have any questions for me in the meantime about buying a home or about anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>&nbsp;
