In today’s message, we’ll run through some do’s and don’ts for deck and patio maintenance on your home.&nbsp;

First, let’s go over the do’s.&nbsp;

<u><strong>Do seal your deck every two to three years.</strong></u> The most efficient means of doing this is using an all-in-one stain and sealer. I would advise against painting your deck because it will peel over time. Staining is the best option.&nbsp;

<u><strong>Do remove debris regularly.</strong></u> Letting debris settle on your deck will cause moisture and mildew to grow thereby leaving behind stains on your deck.&nbsp;

<u><strong>Do fix small issues before they become bigger ones.</strong></u> For example, if nails in your deck are raised, your deck is missing boards, or the wood is splitting, you want to tackle these issues sooner rather than later. Non-action is only going to lead to bigger problems later on down the road.

And, then there are the don’ts:&nbsp;

<u><strong>Don&rsquo;t sand your deck in between stains.</strong></u> You’ll end up stripping the old staining, which will mean applying more new stain than is necessary. Sanding should only ever be used to smooth out a rough, uneven surface.&nbsp;

<u><strong>Don&rsquo;t wash or power wash your deck too much.</strong></u> Both have the potential of ruining the surface of your deck.&nbsp;

<u><strong>Don&rsquo;t use wire brushes.</strong></u> These are sometimes mistakenly used to remove stains, but they also will damage your deck’s surface.&nbsp;

<u><strong>Don&rsquo;t use chlorine bleach.</strong></u> Equally as damaging as overwashing and using wire brushes, bleach will also alter the color of your deck.&nbsp;

Apart from the do’s and don’ts of deck maintenance, there are three deck-related things you’ll want to keep a watchful eye on:&nbsp;

1. Dry rot
2. Cracks&nbsp;
3. Movement &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

Any of these three could be a source of trouble for your deck and, if spotted, should be addressed immediately because they can lead to structural damage over time. As always, feel free to call or email me with any real estate-related questions or comments. I look forward to hearing from you!
