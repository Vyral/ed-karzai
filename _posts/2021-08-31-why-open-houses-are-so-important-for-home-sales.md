When it comes to selling a home, open houses are an important piece of the marketing puzzle.&nbsp;

**The primary reason is their convenience.** Most people don’t work on the weekends, and standard open house timelines run from 1 p.m. to 4 p.m. on Saturdays and Sundays. Buyers aren’t tied down to an exact time, so if they’re running late, they don’t have to stress.

Buyers can see a house outside of open house hours, but that adds a layer of complexity to everything. If your house is vacant, that’s another story, but most sellers live in their homes while they’re on the market. If you do as well, you have to schedule a date and time that’s convenient for everyone involved. If you can’t, it obviously becomes harder to show the home.&nbsp;

In my experience listing homes, I estimate that about 80% of all foot traffic comes from open houses. That number alone should tell you how important open houses are.&nbsp;

**To truly maximize your open house and generate as much foot traffic as possible, you must properly prepare your home.** This means decluttering it, getting it professionally cleaned, and (possibly) staging it. You can also leave it vacant, as vacant homes show well too because they make it look bigger.&nbsp;

It’s also important to have professional photos taken of your home. They will compel online home shoppers to want to see yours in person.&nbsp;

As always, if you have questions about this or any real estate topic or are thinking of buying or selling a home soon, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’m happy to help.
