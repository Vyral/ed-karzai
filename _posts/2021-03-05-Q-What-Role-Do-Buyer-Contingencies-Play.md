How do buyer contingencies function as part of a real estate contract? Generally, there are three main contingencies for most transactions: the inspection contingency, appraisal contingency, and loan contingency. 

**With the inspection contingency, the buyer basically asks the seller to give them a certain amount of time within the escrow period to review the inspection report and any disclosures** to ensure they’re comfortable enough with their results and the condition of the home to move forward with the transaction. If the seller doesn’t schedule an inspection, the buyer can order their own. Once they’re comfortable with everything, the buyer then removes the contingency in writing. None of these contingencies are removed automatically—they have to be removed by the buyer. 

If the buyer isn’t satisfied enough with the inspection report to proceed with the transaction, the inspection contingency allows them to cancel the transaction without losing their deposit. If the buyer removes the inspection contingency but later on decides they’re not comfortable moving forward with the deal, it’s too late to keep their deposit.

**The appraisal contingency basically protects the buyer in the event that the appraisal comes in lower than the contract price.** For example, let’s say the contract price of a home is $1 million and the appraisal comes in at $980,000. At that point, the buyer can ask the seller if they’ll accept $980,000 instead of $1 million or split the difference and accept $990,000. The seller isn’t obligated to accept less than $1 million, though, and if both parties can’t come to an agreement, it’s up to the buyer whether they want to pay out of pocket to move the deal forward. If they don’t, the appraisal contingency allows them to walk away without losing their deposit. 

**In a loan contingency, the buyer asks the seller for a certain amount of time to finalize the details of their loan.** Again, after the buyer removes this contingency, they must close escrow or lose their deposit. In our market, the deposit usually constitutes 3% of the overall sale price. For a $1 million home, that equates to $30,000.

The bottom line is that contingencies are strategically very important in a transaction. If you’d like to discuss this topic in further detail or have other real estate questions I can answer, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.
