{% include youtube.html %}<br>What is home equity? How can you leverage yours if you’re a homeowner?

To answer the first question, home equity is the amount of your home that you own outright. For example, if your house is worth $600,000 and you owe $200,000 on it, the difference—$400,000—is your equity.&nbsp;

There are three common ways people tap into their home equity:

**1\. Equity loan**. Keeping with the example above, let’s say you owe $200,000 and you want to take out $200,000 from your equity. That $200,000 then becomes a second loan, which you get as cash.&nbsp;<br>**2\. Equity line of credit** (commonly referred to as “HELOC”). This loan works like a credit card in that you only pay interest on what you use. If you get approved for $200,000 of your equity but you only use $50,000 of it, you only pay on that amount. &nbsp;<br>**3\. Cash-out refinance.** With this, you simply refinance your existing loan into a new loan.

Why would you take that money out of your home to begin with? Here are a few of the most common reasons:

* **Pay off other debt** (credit card debt, student loans, medical bills, etc.). Typically, the interest rates for HELOC loans are lower than private bank loans or credit cards.&nbsp;
* **Pay for home improvements.**
* **Pay for their next home after selling their current one.** Equity comes in handy for people who want to upsize and buy the home they really want.&nbsp;
