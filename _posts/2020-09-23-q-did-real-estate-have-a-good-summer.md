How did our Santa Clara County real estate market perform this summer? In June, the average single-family home in Santa Clara County sold for $1.379 million. In July, that average effectively stayed flat at $1.37 million, but then **we saw it increase to $1.4 million in August.&nbsp;**

Let’s take a look at the sale-to-list price ratio, which tells us how much the average single-family home actually sold for compared to the price for which it was listed. In June, the average sale-to-list ratio was 99.9%, meaning that **the average seller got virtually 100% of what they wanted for their home.** In July, the average sale-to-list ratio rose to 101.4%, meaning that the average home sold for 1.4% more than what it was listed at. In August, the ratio increased yet again to 102.2%.&nbsp;

In June, the total number of single-family homes that sold throughout the county was 887, while 1,057 sold in July, and 973 sold in August. These numbers indicate a more than healthy amount of activity in our market.&nbsp;

What about inventory, or the total amount of active single-family homes on the market for a given month? **There were 1,161 active listings in June, 1,080 in July, and 996 in August.** The market was moving incredibly fast in June; the average home spent just seven days on the market before its seller accepted an offer. In July, homes spent an average of 17 days on the market, and the average August listing spent 19.&nbsp;

**Overall, our summer market was a strong one.** There was a ton of activity across the board, prices went up, and it didn’t take long for sellers to fetch the right offer for their homes. The biggest driver of our hot market has been the extremely low interest rates; right now, the average rate for a 30-year fixed loan is in the low 3% range, so plenty of people are taking advantage and buying now.&nbsp;
