How does a buyer’s deposit work in a real estate transaction? When a buyer makes an offer and the seller accepts it, the buyer must put a deposit into escrow. In most of the Bay area, **the standard amount of the buyer’s deposit is 3% of the purchase price.** For example, if the purchase price is $1 million, then the buyer has to put $30,000 into escrow.&nbsp;

The contract gives the buyer three business days to place the deposit into escrow. For instance, if the home goes under contract on a Thursday, the buyer has until the end of Tuesday to get the deposit into escrow. However, we’re currently in a competitive seller’s market, and sellers are receiving multiple offers. So we often see buyers submit their deposits to escrow within one business day.&nbsp;

The contract has three contingencies that protect the deposit in case the buyer cannot move forward—the inspection, appraisal, and loan contingencies. However, the buyer doesn’t have to put all three contingencies in the contract, they’re all negotiable. Right now, to make their offer stronger and more competitive, we’re seeing buyers waive one, two, or even all three of these contingencies. **Many buyers are waiving&nbsp;*****all \*\**contingencies in a multiple-offer situation. \*\***

So, if a buyer makes an offer with no contingencies, that offer gets accepted, and they place their deposit into escrow, but then they default on the contact, they may lose their deposit. Thus it’s crucial to know how the buyer’s deposit works.&nbsp;

**The buyer’s deposit is credited toward their down payment**, so if a buyer’s down payment is $200,000 and they put $30,000 into escrow upfront, then $170,000 is due at closing.&nbsp;
