If you’re a home seller, the seller rent-back agreement is a tool you can negotiate for in the purchase contract that buys you extra time before you have to move out.&nbsp;

Normally the escrow period lasts 30 days after a seller accepts an offer from a buyer. On the 30th day (i.e., the day escrow closes), you get the money from the sale, the buyer becomes the legal owner of the property, and you have to move out. With a seller rent-back agreement in place, though, **you’ll have an extra one or two months to move out after the close of escrow.** During this time, you stay in the property as a tenant. You can move out whenever you’re ready, but two months is the maximum period. The buyer’s lender won’t allow you to stay any longer, because at that point the situation turns into a long-term lease, which they’re not comfortable with.&nbsp;&nbsp;

Since you’re living in the house as a tenant, the buyer more or less becomes the landlord, and the lease agreement you both sign is negotiable. You can stay free of charge for both months, pay for one month and get the next month free, or pay for both months.&nbsp;

In any case, **this agreement really comes in handy if you’re looking to sell right away but don’t want to move out right away.** It also comes in handy if you need to sell and buy but haven’t found the right house to move into yet.&nbsp;
