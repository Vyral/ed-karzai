I’m sure most of you are already familiar with Zillow. They have a popular tool on their website called a “Zestimate,” which gives you an instant valuation for your home. I always hear from buyers and sellers who want to know how accurate their Zestimate is, so I’ll separate facts from fiction today.

If you want a good ballpark estimate of what a property may be worth, the Zestimate is a fantastic tool. However, **if you’re a serious homebuyer or seller who wants to know the precise value of a property, it’s not what you should use.**&nbsp;

Instead, you should hire a real estate professional to come out, take a look at the property in person, and give you their professional estimation of its value. An agent or appraiser who is an expert in the market can give you a strong, accurate valuation. Zillow doesn’t know about your neighborhood, your home’s unique upgrades or finishes, and many other factors that can make a huge difference in value.

Let’s imagine two different homes that are identical from the outside. However, one has a compartmentalized floor plan and the other has an open floor plan. Even though the houses are identical otherwise, the open floor plan is going to be worth more because it’s what buyers want in today’s market. The same goes for homes on different sides of the street or with different types of flooring.

All of these things make a difference in what your home is worth on the market, and **there is no way that Zillow or any other website can break it down at that level.**&nbsp;

If you want me to let you know what your home is worth or you have any other questions about real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email today. I’d love to hear from you.
